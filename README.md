# 🌉 IntentBridge - Natural Language API Execution 

 

Transform natural language into API calls instantly. No documentation. No SDKs. Just describe what you want.
Built for the Descope MCP Hackathon 2025. 

 

## 🚀 What is IntentBridge? 

 

IntentBridge is an MCP server that acts as a universal translator between AI agents and ANY API. Instead of writing integration code for each API, users can simply say what they want in natural language. 

 
### The Problem​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 

- Every API requires different SDKs, authentication, and documentation 

- AI agents can't directly interact with external services 

- Developers waste hours on API integrations 

- Each new API means more code to write and maintain 

 

### The Solution 

IntentBridge eliminates ALL of this complexity:
